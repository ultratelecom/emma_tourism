SECTION ONE: WHY WE NEED A PATHWAY

1.0. Introduction

1.1. Grounded in five fundamental pillars, the Strategic Development Planning Pathway represents a foundational framework for integrated development planning.

1.2. The pathway connects key considerations related to (1) governance principles, (2) public problems, (3) their policy solutions, (4) legislative protections, (5) plans or strategies, (6) programme and associated targets, and (7) project-based actions.

1.3. Primarily, the pathway promotes and facilitates coordinated, objective, and logical development planning within and between all divisions and agencies of the Tobago House of Assembly and between the Tobago House of Assembly, other levels of government and civil society.

1.4. The pathway is premised on the fundamental idea that development planning encompasses the spatial and temporal dimensions of all human interactions, i.e., social interactions among people, as well as the interactions between people and their natural and built environments.

1.5. Development planning helps to order these interactions within social, cultural, and economic systems, agroecological and social-ecological systems, infrastructure networks, and human settlements.

1.6. By ordering these interactions, development planning helps to guide collective decision-making processes across multiple levels of government and civil society organizations in finding solutions to public problems, to achieve the most plausible development outcomes in focus areas related to education, the environment, agriculture, healthcare, human settlements, tourism and the like.

2.0. Important historical planning considerations

2.1. In early 2022, various interest groups in Tobago began to emphasize the need for a new development plan—a comprehensive, written document—to provide a clear pathway for developing Tobago's society and economy.

2.2. The overtures regarding the need for a new development plan were primarily based on the change in government in the Tobago House of Assembly in December 2021, after more than two decades.

2.3. Many Tobagonians and interest groups in Tobago interpreted the change in government as a rejection of a national political and economic hegemony, a signal for a new governance mandate, and, by extension, the need for novel and innovative approaches to planning and development in line with the ideals, wishes, and aspirations of past, current and future generations of Tobagonians.

2.4. However, although the calls for a new development plan for Tobago may have been sincere, they must be examined within the context of the history of development plans for Tobago.

2.5. The empirical evidence shows that Tobago has been well-resourced over the last six decades with a suite of development plans. A list of these plans is provided below.

Table 1. Matrix of Development Plans for Tobago: 1965 to 2024

SECTION TWO: DEFINING THE PATHWAY

1.0. What is the strategic development planning pathway, SDPP?

The Strategic Development Planning Pathway (SDPP) is a comprehensive, integrated framework designed to guide Tobago's development from 2025 to 2045. It serves as a roadmap for achieving Tobago's vision of becoming "The Greatest Little Island on the Planet."

2.0. How is strategic development planning defined?

Strategic development planning is the systematic process of identifying long-term goals, formulating policies, designing programs, and implementing projects to achieve sustainable development outcomes. It encompasses spatial, economic, social, and environmental dimensions of development.

3.0. How is the Development Planning Pathway integrated?

The SDPP integrates multiple levels and aspects of planning:
- Horizontal integration across THA divisions
- Vertical integration between THA and national government
- Temporal integration across short-term, medium-term, and long-term planning horizons
- Sectoral integration across economic, social, environmental, and infrastructure development

4.0. What are the functional dimensions of integration?

The SDPP operates across four functional dimensions:
1. Policy Integration - Coordinating policies across divisions
2. Program Integration - Aligning programs with strategic priorities
3. Spatial Integration - Ensuring development respects Tobago's geography
4. Stakeholder Integration - Engaging all relevant parties in planning processes

5.0. How is the Development Planning Pathway strategic?

The SDPP is strategic because it:
- Establishes clear long-term vision and goals
- Identifies key priorities and development agenda items
- Provides systematic decision-making frameworks
- Ensures alignment between different levels of planning
- Promotes evidence-based decision making

6.0. Is the SDPP a development plan?

No, the SDPP is not a traditional development plan. Instead, it is a planning framework or pathway that guides the creation of multiple development plans. It provides the methodology, principles, and structure for developing sector-specific and area-specific plans.

7.0. How will the THA produce development plans using the SDPP?

Using the SDPP framework, the THA will produce development plans through a structured process:
1. Pre-Planning stage - establishing context and baselines
2. Core Planning stage - formulating strategies and programs
3. Development Program Planning and Implementation - detailed program design
4. Monitoring, Evaluation, Innovation & Revision - continuous improvement

8.0. How would the pathways influence the work of divisions of the THA?

Each THA division will use the SDPP to:
- Align their policies with the 21 Development Agenda Priorities
- Develop division-specific plans using prescribed formats
- Coordinate with other divisions through the framework
- Report progress using standardized monitoring systems

9.0. What are the potential development planning implications of the SDPP?

The SDPP implies:
- Shift from centralized to divisional responsibility for planning
- Establishment of new institutional structures
- Adoption of integrated planning approaches
- Enhanced coordination between THA and national government
- Regular review and updating of development priorities

10.0. SDPP online platform

The SDPP will be supported by a comprehensive online platform providing:
- Digital access to planning documents
- Interactive tools for plan development
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Stakeholder engagement features
- Training modules for planning practitioners

SECTION THREE: DEVELOPMENT PILLARS

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND SPENDING IN THE THA

Program-Based Budgeting Approach:
Under the Strategic Development Planning Pathway, expenditure for development will not be determined based on project expenditure schedules. Development expenditure will be determined based on macro-level expenditure forecasting in line with projected GDP growth targets (see DAP A).

Divisions of the THA and their agencies will use the projected budget forecast related to their areas of responsibility to prepare focus area program budgets.

This Program-Based budgeting approach at the level of the divisions of the THA will first subsume and then replace the Project-Based Budgeting currently used by the THA's divisions.

In the interim, divisions will continue to use a project-based budgeting approach. However, project expenditures will be aggregated to align with Focus Area Program expenditures.

Program-Based Budgeting Benefits:
a. Transparency: Program-based budgets will offer a clearer understanding of the costs and potential benefits of a program.
b. Accountability: Program-based budgets are connected to measurable targets and indicators of progress and success, which help assess the value of expenditures on specific programs. Consequently, increases or decreases in funding for a program will be based objectively on performance measures.
c. Data-Driven Decision-making: Program-based budgeting will ensure that budgetary planning and executive decision-making are closely aligned to focus area programs and informed by pertinent, verifiable targets.
d. Effective alignment and management of investment: Program-based budgeting will allow for the organization of funding for focus area programs into various categories and levels of capital investment associated with GDP growth in key economies.

Levels of Capital Investment:
i. The levels of investment will include tier 1, tier 2, tier 3, and tier 4. This investment hierarchy will be based on the value of the investment.

Categories of Capital Investment:
ii. The categories of investment will include physical, human/institutional, environmental, cultural, social, and technological or innovation capital, among others.

Budget Classification (Decision Step 6):
- Focus area program budgets are consolidated into larger expenditure levels and categories
- Essential for assessing viable expenditure options under resource constraints
- Facilitates medium- to long-term management of development expenditure
- Aids in forecasting development expenditures across five-year development cycles
- Provides forward guidance related to capital investment expenditures for targeted GDP growth

Implementation Modalities (Decision Step 7):
- Programs can be implemented using program modality or project modality
- May be delivered through community-based models or partnerships between private sector and government
- Choice of modality depends on managerial, technical, and financial capacities
- Modalities include direct government implementation, collaboration with private businesses, international funding agencies, and community organizations

Monitoring and Evaluation Framework:
- Targets are tracked and monitored using prescribed time intervals
- Performance Management Commitment for Results Framework (CFR) focuses on project implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting
- Divisions utilize prescribed templates to track program performance
- Quarterly and annual reports submitted in standard format
- Results-oriented reporting with open-access dashboard for accountability and transparency

Development Planning Cycles:
- Planning and development occurs within five-year planning cycles
- First cycle begins September 1, 2025 (fiscal 2026) and ends August 31, 2029 (fiscal 2029)
- Cycles overlap THA terms for seamless policy transition

Tobago Regional Spatial Development Atlas (TRSDA):
- Online regional development plan containing spatial and attribute data
- Guides regional planning and development across all three development planning regions
- Includes geographic information systems for integrated planning

Institutional Arrangements:
- Division of Finance and the Economy manages development program budgeting
- Tobago Capital Investment Development Program (TCIDP) for expenditure management
- Establishment of Tobago Development Fund (TDF) and Tobago Economic Development Corporation (TEDCO)
- Gross Economic-Ecological Accounting Framework (GEAF) incorporates resource consumption, environmental impact damage, and ecological benefits

Spending Alignment with DAPs:
Financial resources are directed toward specific DAPs, ensuring alignment with strategic priorities. Each division creates comprehensive plans with detailed budgets, coordinated through the SDPP framework. The pathway includes mechanisms for monitoring and assessing spending effectiveness, allowing for adjustments and continuous improvement.

INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE SDPP

Institutional Environment for Planning:
Currently, the government of Trinidad and Tobago has adopted the National Spatial Development Strategy (NSDS) as official policy. The NSDS identifies spatial extent of development for Tobago, but overlooks several key areas and doesn't support the THA's ambition for a third Development Planning Region (Greater Scarborough Integrated Planning Region).

Tobago will be divided into three Development Planning Regions instead of the NSDS's two regions, providing spatial basis for identifying public problems and implementing policy solutions.

Tobago Regional Spatial Development Atlas (TRSDA):
The THA will develop TRSDA as Tobago's online regional development plan containing spatial and attribute data to guide planning. Includes all three development planning regions, hosted on GIS-based platform with open-source features for stakeholder access.

Development Planning Cycles:
Planning occurs within five-year cycles overlapping THA terms for seamless policy transition. First cycle: September 1, 2025 - August 31, 2029 (fiscal 2026-2029).

People's Development Policy Agenda:
Strategic policy agenda derives from direct engagement with Tobagonians through continuous public engagement processes. Division of Planning and Development develops Public Engagement Policy with principles and processes.
