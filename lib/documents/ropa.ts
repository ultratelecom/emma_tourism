SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS

The relationship between national elections and THA elections:

1. COMMON FRAMEWORK: Both parliamentary elections and THA elections are governed by the same Representation of the People Act and administered by the Elections and Boundaries Commission.

2. SEPARATE ELECTORAL PROCESSES: While using the same legal framework, THA elections are held independently of parliamentary elections. The dissolution of one body does not affect the other.

3. VOTER REGISTRATION: Citizens registered to vote in Tobago's electoral districts may vote in both parliamentary elections (for the Tobago East and Tobago West constituencies) and THA elections (for their respective Assembly electoral district).

4. ELECTIONS AND BOUNDARIES COMMISSION: The same national body oversees both types of elections, ensuring consistency and integrity in the electoral process.

5. CONCURRENT ELIGIBILITY: A person may not simultaneously serve as an Assemblyman and as a Senator or Member of the House of Representatives. Acceptance of one position vacates the other.

6. CONSTITUTIONAL OVERSIGHT: The President issues writs for THA elections on the advice of the Elections and Boundaries Commission, maintaining national oversight of the process.

7. JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT: Election petitions for both parliamentary and THA elections are heard by the same High Court, applying the same legal standards.

This framework ensures that while Tobago has its own elected Assembly, the electoral process remains integrated with the national democratic system of Trinidad and Tobago.
