PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARLIAMENT AND THE ASSEMBLY

The Constitution establishes a hierarchical relationship between Parliament and the Tobago House of Assembly:

1. LEGISLATIVE SUPREMACY: Acts of Parliament prevail over Tobago Laws in case of inconsistency (Section 141D(4)).

2. CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION: The Assembly derives its existence and authority from the Constitution itself (Section 141A).

3. FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP: The Assembly receives funding from the Consolidated Fund through Parliamentary appropriation (Section 141F).

4. LIMITED AUTONOMY: The Assembly has "such powers of self-government in Tobago as may be conferred upon it by or under any law" (Section 141A(3)), indicating Parliament retains ultimate authority.

5. MATTERS RESERVED TO PARLIAMENT: The Fifth Schedule specifically excludes certain matters from the Assembly's purview, including:
   - Offshore lands and resources
   - Statutory bodies
   - Tertiary education
   - Any matter not expressly delegated

6. PRESIDENTIAL ASSENT: Tobago Laws require the President's assent to become effective (Section 141D(3)), providing a check on the Assembly's legislative power.

7. ELECTORAL FRAMEWORK: Electoral districts in Tobago are established under Section 71 of the Constitution, maintaining national oversight of the democratic process.

This constitutional framework reflects Tobago's status as an integral part of the unitary state of Trinidad and Tobago, while providing a measure of self-governance in specified matters.
